# VNonograms
 Nonograms/picross for Pico-8
 Explanation on how nonograms work from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram):
 
 Nonograms [...] are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture. In this puzzle type, the numbers are a form of discrete tomography that measures how many unbroken lines of filled-in squares there are in any given row or column. For example, a clue of "4 8 3" would mean there are sets of four, eight, and three filled squares, in that order, with at least one blank square between successive sets. 
 
 ### Controls
 VNonograms uses the default Pico-8 control scheme, that being:
 
 Up/Down/Left/Right: With the arrow keys, WASD or the dpad/joystick on your controller
 
 Accept/Reveal colored tile: Z / C / N / (A) or (Y) on XBox controllers
 
 Mark tile as blank: X / V / M / (B) or (X) on Xbox controllers
